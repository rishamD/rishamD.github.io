## Ray Tracer | Using Processing – 							December 2023

- I implemented a ray casting algorithm to trace rays from the camera through each pixel on the canvas. For each ray, I calculated intersections with the objects in the scene to determine what the ray hits.
- I calculated lighting effects such as diffuse and specular reflections at each intersection point. I considered the positions and properties of light sources in the scene to determine how they contribute to the illumination of object.
