## Student Echo | Android App - [[GitLab](https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2024/KeyValuePairs-a02-8)[\]](https://github.com/WilliamOdumah/Student-Echo)                                                                            January 2024 - Present 
- Spearheaded the development of "Student Echo", an Android application designed to allow university students to rate and review courses and instructors, facilitating informed decisions about class registrations. 
- Utilized **Java** for Android app development, focusing on features such as review submission, review editing, and the deletion of reviews to enhance user engagement and content accuracy. 
- Integrated a custom backend solution for data management, ensuring efficient handling of user-generated content and reviews. 
- Implemented rigorous testing protocols to identify and rectify bugs, thus achieving 80% test coverage ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience. 

## Ray Tracer | Using Processing – 							December 2023

- I implemented a ray casting algorithm to trace rays from the camera through each pixel on the canvas. For each ray, I calculated intersections with the objects in the scene to determine what the ray hits.
- I calculated lighting effects such as diffuse and specular reflections at each intersection point. I considered the positions and properties of light sources in the scene to determine how they contribute to the illumination of object.
