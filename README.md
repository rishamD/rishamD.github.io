# README: Hosting Your Resume on GitHub Pages

Hello! In this README, I'll guide you through the process of hosting your resume on GitHub Pages. My aim is not only to provide technical steps but ensuring clarity, simplicity, and a user-centric approach in your documentation.

## Prerequisites:
- Resume [MyResume](https://github.com/rishamD/rishamD.github.io/blob/main/index.md).
- Guide [ReadMeGuide](https://www.makeareadme.com/).

## Principles
1. **Simplicity:** Keep instructions clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary jargon or complexity.
2. **Clarity:** Ensure each step is easy to understand, leaving no room for ambiguity.
3. **User-centricity:** Anticipate the needs and questions of your audience, providing relevant information and addressing potential concerns.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Create a GitHub Account (if you haven't already):

If you don't have a GitHub account, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a free account.

### 2. Create a New Repository:

- Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner of your GitHub account and select "New repository."
- Name your repository `yourusername.github.io`, replacing `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.
- Optionally, add a description and choose whether to make it public or private.

### 3. Prepare Your Resume:

Before proceeding, ensure your resume is in Markdown format. If it's in another format (e.g., Microsoft Word or PDF), you'll need to convert it to Markdown. You can use online converters or Markdown editors of your choice.

### 4. Upload Your Resume:

- Once your repository is created, navigate to it.
- Click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files."
- Upload your Markdown resume file to the repository.

### 5. Enable GitHub Pages:

- Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
- In order to enable pages you need to make your repository public or buy Github premium.
- Select "main" or "master" branch (depending on your default branch).
- Click "Save."
### 6. Access Your Hosted Resume:

- After saving, scroll back down to the "GitHub Pages" section to find the link to your hosted resume.
- It should be something like `https://yourusername.github.io`.

Congratulations! Your resume is now hosted on GitHub Pages and accessible to anyone with the provided link.
