## SUMMARY


Computer Science graduate from the University of Manitoba with a strong interest in software development, mobile applications, and user-focused
design. My academic experience includes building full-stack projects, working in Agile teams, and developing applications using languages like Java
and Python.
I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and contributing to clean, efficient code. I am now looking to apply my skills in a
professional setting and continue growing as a developer.

## EXPERIENCE

## Industrial Project


Advancement Services, University of Manitoba January 2025 - April 2025,Winnipeg, Manitoba

### •
- Spearheaded the development of a scalable pipeline to extract structured data from obituaries and match them to alumni records using large
language models (LLMs).
- Designed and fine-tuned prompts for consistent JSON output across multiple LLM APIs, capturing key personal and academic attributes.
- Built a weighted scoring matrix to benchmark model performance over 500+ real-world cases, incorporating priority-based evaluation metrics.
- Applied fuzzy string matching to handle typographical errors and name variants, enhancing matching accuracy.
- Conducted comparative performance analysis (accuracy, F1 score, consistency) with Python-based visualizations and reporting.
- Modularized the pipeline into reusable components for extraction, scoring, and evaluation, ensuring future extensibility and reproducibility.

## PROJECT

## RestroSync


Restaurant Management System University Project•January 2025 - April 2025
Developed RESTful API endpoints in Node.js with custom date validation and default fallback logic, supporting dynamic queries across sales,
orders, and menu data.

### •


Implemented secure JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (Owner, Manager, Employee), protecting all API routes and UI access
paths.

### •


Designed and enforced allergen tagging and validation logic for 100+ menu items, enabling automatic warnings for common allergens like nuts
and gluten.

### •


Built real-time order tracking with polling and two-way sync, allowing managers to update order states live and reflect changes instantly on the
frontend.

### •

- Created reusable React components for menu CRUD, order cards, and analytics visualizations using Chart.js and conditional rendering.
- Engineered responsive React interfaces for daily operations, including menu management, live kitchen view, and time-filtered sales dashboards.

## Student Echo


Android Application University Project•January 2024 - April 2024

- Designed and developed a native Android app for university students to rate and review courses and instructors.
- Structured the codebase with a modular Java architecture, leveraging activities, fragments, and persistent local storage (SQLite).
- Implemented full CRUD functionality for reviews with form validation and consistent UI state management.
- Utilized RecyclerView with custom adapters for dynamic and efficient rendering of user-generated content.
- Followed Agile methodology with weekly sprints, version control via GitLab, and structured issue tracking.
- Focused on clean design patterns (MVC), intuitive navigation, and scalable component architecture for future extensibility.
